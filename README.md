# Introvoke System Design Interview

Welcome to the Introvoke system design interview project! ðŸ‘‹

## Objective

Your assignment is to architect and design a system for a new chat application. This application will contain the following features:

- A user interface that allows users to join the chat, submit messages, read messages
- The ability to run analytics on messages which are sent. The following are some examples:
  - Aggregations on messages (total messages by user, messages over a given time period)
  - A sentiment analysis of the chat message which gives a score based on whether the chat message contains language which is positive (1), negative (-1), or neutral/unknown (0)

When designing the system, you should be prepared to handle the following scenarios:

1. Communication between the user interface and the backend systems
2. Storing the data used within the system
3. Data input/output schemas, structure of the data throughout the system
4. Processing and analyzing the data within the application
5. Any other systems/process/cases you encounter while designing

## Expected Output

At the end of this exercise you will present your design to the team and should be prepared to show the following:

- A flowchart or diagram with a high-level system design for the chat application
- (Optional) Additional flowcharts or diagrams for any inner system processes if needed

You may implement and design the system in any way you choose. Be prepared to discuss your decisions, any third-party solutions used and the pros/cons of your choices.

Feel free to use any tools to help aid you in completing this assignment. We recommend using a flowchart/diagraming tool such as [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) or [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).
